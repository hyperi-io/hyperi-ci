# TODO — HyperI CI

This is the **single source of truth** for all tasks and progress.

## Active Tasks

### Split-Runner Architecture + Release Gating

Multi-arch builds via native runners per architecture instead of cross-compilation sysroot.
`main` = dev pre-releases (x64 only), `release` = GA releases (x64 + arm64).

#### Phase 1: Documentation + SSOT

- [x] Update `config/versions.yaml` — add `upload-artifact: v7`, `download-artifact: v8`
- [x] Update `scripts/update-versions.py` — add upload/download-artifact to `_ACTION_OWNERS`
- [x] Apply version updates to all 4 workflow files (v4 → v7)
- [ ] Update `TODO.md` with full WBS (this section)
- [ ] Update `docs/DESIGN.md` — replace cross-compile section with split-runner architecture
- [ ] Create `config/runners.yaml` — runner SSOT per architecture

#### Phase 2: Workflow Templates

- [ ] `rust-ci.yml` — add setup job, build matrix (x64 ARC + arm64 native), remove cross-compile step
- [ ] `python-ci.yml` — update Release/Publish conditions for main + release branches
- [ ] `go-ci.yml` — update Release/Publish conditions for main + release branches
- [ ] `ts-ci.yml` — update Release/Publish conditions for main + release branches
- [ ] All workflows — Release on main (prerelease) + release (GA), Publish only on release

#### Phase 3: Release Configuration

- [ ] Update `init.py` `_render_releaserc()` — two-branch config (main=dev, release=GA)
- [ ] Update Release job conditions in all workflows (main || release)
- [ ] Publish job only on `release` branch

#### Phase 4: CLI — `init-release` Command

- [ ] Create `src/hyperi_ci/init_release.py` — init-release implementation
- [ ] Register `init-release` in `cli.py`
- [ ] Integrate with `migrate.py`

#### Phase 5: Commit + Push

- [ ] Commit GH Actions version fix (already staged)
- [ ] Commit architecture changes
- [ ] Push and verify hyperi-ci CI passes

#### Phase 6: Test with Consumer Projects

- [ ] hyperi-rustlib — `init-release`, verify dev + GA flow
- [ ] dfe-loader — `init-release`, verify x64 dev build, x64+arm64 GA build
- [ ] dfe-receiver — `init-release`, verify CI passes
- [ ] hyperi-pylib — `init-release`, verify CI passes
- [ ] dfe-engine — `init-release`, verify CI passes

### Generic Binary Publishing (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

- [x] Phase 1: Generic binary publish module (`publish_binaries.py`)
  - [x] Extract shared binary upload from Go handler into language-agnostic module
  - [x] GitHub Releases upload (`gh release upload`)
  - [x] JFrog generic binary upload
  - [x] Call `publish_binaries()` from `dispatch.py` after language handler
  - [x] Skip `cargo publish` for binary apps (auto-detect via `_detect_binary_names()`)
  - [x] Remove binary publish from Go handler (now in shared module)
  - [x] Workflow artifact passing (upload in build, download in publish)
- [x] Phase 2: Cloudflare R2 binary download site (`downloads.hyperi.io`)
  - [x] R2 bucket `bin-repo` created (APAC region)
  - [x] Cloudflare Worker `bin-repo-index` deployed (directory listing + file serving)
  - [x] DNS AAAA record for `downloads.hyperi.io` (proxied)
  - [x] Terraform IaC at `/projects/hyperi-infra/cloud/repo-bin/terraform/`
  - [x] R2 upload function `_publish_r2_binaries()` in `publish_binaries.py`
  - [x] R2 credentials stored: `~/.env`, GitHub org secrets, OpenBao
  - [x] Logo uploaded to R2 `_assets/logo.svg`
  - [x] End-to-end test verified (upload → serve → directory listing)
  - [x] hyperi-ci pushed and published to PyPI
- [ ] First real CI-driven R2 upload (next dfe-receiver code change to release branch)

### Other Active Tasks

- [ ] Address non-blocking quality warnings across all three consumer projects
  - vulture: dead code in hyperi-pylib, dfe-engine (non-blocking)
  - semgrep: security patterns in dfe-engine (non-blocking)
  - ty: type errors in all three (non-blocking, replaces pyright)
  - cargo audit: advisory DB issues in hyperi-rustlib (non-blocking)

## Backlog

### High Priority

- [ ] Validate TypeScript pipeline end-to-end (after Rust)
  - ci-test-ts-minimal exists in test-projects — use for testing
  - Need a real consumer TypeScript project to cut over

- [ ] Validate Go pipeline end-to-end (after TypeScript)

- [ ] Reliable migration automation and documentation for existing `ci/` submodule projects
  - 14+ consumer projects need to cut over from old `ci/` submodule to `hyperi-ci init`
  - Need: migration script, step-by-step docs, rollback plan
  - Must handle: removing old `ci/` submodule, cleaning `.gitmodules`, generating new files
  - Test on 1-2 projects first, then automate the rest

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Consumer project cutover — remove `ci/` submodule, run `hyperi-ci init`, verify
- [ ] Archive old repo — `hyperi-io/ci` → read-only

### Requires Design Discussion

- [ ] **OSS deployment model and access control**
  - **Decision:** hyperi-ci = public, hyperi-pylib = public PyPI, hyperi-ai = private
  - **Open questions:**
    - Expenditure controls: runner minute budgets per external contributor/org
    - Secrets governance: ensure no secrets baked into CI config that could leak
    - hyperi-ai access: private submodule means external forks won't have it — verify graceful skip works well in practice
    - Publishing gates: even with `publish-target: oss`, only HyperI maintainers should trigger publish to PyPI/npm/crates.io
    - Dependency supply chain: external PRs modifying `uv.lock`/`package-lock.json` need extra review
    - External contributor onboarding: how do non-HyperI devs discover and use hyperi-ci?
    - Approval workflow: currently using GitHub "Require approval for first-time contributors" + fork PRs get quality+test only (no secrets, no build/publish) — is this sufficient?
    - Cost allocation: if OSS projects get significant external contribution, who pays for CI minutes?

## Notes for AI Assistants

This file is the **single source of truth** for tasks and progress.

**Rules:**

- All tasks go here, nowhere else
- Planning mode outputs go here (WBS section)
- Mark tasks `[IN PROGRESS]` when starting
- Mark tasks `[x]` when complete, move to Completed section
- Never add tasks to STATE.md or CLAUDE.md
