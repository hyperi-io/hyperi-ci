# TODO — HyperI CI

This is the **single source of truth** for all tasks and progress.

---

## Active Tasks

- [ ] Make `init` existing-project-smart per language `[PENDING]`
- [ ] Evaluate hyperi-pylib usage vs bespoke code in hyperi-ci `[PENDING]`

---

## Backlog

### High Priority

- [ ] Publish handlers — wire `src/hyperi_ci/publish/` with JFrog + OSS routing per `PUBLISH_TARGET`
- [ ] Validate with test projects — create GitHub repos, push, verify CI end-to-end
- [ ] Reliable migration automation and documentation for existing `ci/` submodule attached projects
  - 14+ consumer projects need to cut over from old `ci/` submodule to `hyperi-ci init`
  - Need: migration script, step-by-step docs, rollback plan
  - Must handle: removing old `ci/` submodule, cleaning `.gitmodules`, generating new files
  - Test on 1-2 projects first, then automate the rest

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Consumer project cutover — remove `ci/` submodule, run `hyperi-ci init`, verify
- [ ] Archive old repo — `hyperi-io/ci` → read-only

### Requires Design Discussion

- [ ] **OSS deployment model and access control**
  - **Decision:** hyperi-ci = public, hyperi-pylib = public PyPI, hyperi-ai = private
  - **Open questions:**
    - Expenditure controls: runner minute budgets per external contributor/org
    - Secrets governance: ensure no secrets baked into CI config that could leak
    - hyperi-ai access: private submodule means external forks won't have it — verify graceful skip works well in practice
    - Publishing gates: even with `publish-target: oss`, only HyperI maintainers should trigger publish to PyPI/npm/crates.io
    - Dependency supply chain: external PRs modifying `uv.lock`/`package-lock.json` need extra review
    - External contributor onboarding: how do non-HyperI devs discover and use hyperi-ci?
    - Approval workflow: currently using GitHub "Require approval for first-time contributors" + fork PRs get quality+test only (no secrets, no build/publish) — is this sufficient?
    - Cost allocation: if OSS projects get significant external contribution, who pays for CI minutes?

## Completed (This Session)

- [x] Add hyperi-ai standards submodule
- [x] Create reusable workflow templates (python-ci, rust-ci, ts-ci, go-ci)
- [x] Add `init` command (generates .hyperi-ci.yaml, Makefile, workflow)
- [x] Add `trigger`, `watch`, `logs` commands (ported from old CI)
- [x] 51 tests passing, lint clean

## Notes for AI Assistants

This file is the **single source of truth** for tasks and progress.

**Rules:**

- All tasks go here, nowhere else
- Planning mode outputs go here (WBS section)
- Mark tasks `[IN PROGRESS]` when starting
- Mark tasks `[x]` when complete, move to Completed section
- Never add tasks to STATE.md or CLAUDE.md
